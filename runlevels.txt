systemd runlevels

It is also possible to isolate any of the targets or move to two special targets :

rescue: Local file systems are mounted, there is no networking, and only root user (maintenance mode)
emergency: Only the root file system and in read-only mode, No networking and only root (maintenance mode)
reboot
halt: Stops all processes and halts CPU activities
poweroff: Like halt but also sends an ACPI shutdown signal (No lights!)

with "systemctl isolate modeName" command we can go to any of the mode above
also we can use "init stageNo" command to go to the stage of 0 to 6 of below

SysV runlevels


On SysV we were able to define different stages. On a Red Hat-based system we usually had 7:

0- Shutdown
1- Single-user mode (recovery); Also called S or s
2- Multi-user without networking
3- Multi-user with networking
4- to be customized by the admin
5- Multi-user with networking and graphics
6- Reboot


And in Debian based system we had:

0- Shutdown
1- Single-user mode
2- Multi-user mode with graphics
6- Reboot
