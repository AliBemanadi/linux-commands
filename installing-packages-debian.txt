If you only want a dry-run/simulation:
apt-get install -s tmux

this will only download the files needed into the cache without installing them:
apt-get install --download-only tmux

The downloaded packages are stored as a cache in /var/cache/apt/archive/.


If you want to download only one specific package, you can do:
apt-get download tmux

Removing debian packages:
apt-get remove tmux

And if you want to remove automatically installed dependencies:
$ apt-get autoremove tmux

or even
$ apt-get autoremove
To autoremove whatever is not needed anymore.



Searching for packages:

If you are using the apt suit, the search is done via apt-cache or you can use the general apt.

$ apt-cache search "tiny window"
$ apt search grub2



Upgrading:

For updating a single package:
apt-get install tzdata

And for upgrading whatever is installed:
apt-get upgrade

Or going to a new distribution:
apt-get dist-upgrade
