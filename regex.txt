useful switch:

-v -> reverse the search
-n -> show line numbers
-l -> show only file names
-i -> case insensitive
-r -> read all files under each directory, recursively

egrep -> is extended grep that can use more regexes
fgrep -> is fixed grep and don't think to much and don't use regex

-r -> use advanced regex
-n -> i don't undrestand the meaninig (suppress output, you can use p at the end of your regex to print the output)
